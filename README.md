# GaTech-Buzzy-Bowl
This is the Course project of ECE 6122 Advanced Programming Techniques. Supervisor: Dr. Jeffery Hurley  
In this project, I developed a 3D simulation of a UAV show over a football field, using OpenGL and MPI. Specifically, I used 16 threads to control each UAV respectively, which are capable of real-time communication with each other.  
Please refer to "final project.pdf" for full description.
